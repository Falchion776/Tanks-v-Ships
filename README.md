This is a simple personal project in Game Maker Studio project to help me learn the tools.

I started this project a few months ago, but am returning to it after some time away. My goal is to work on it a little bit each day. My plan is to create a game that plays something like a reverse Xevious would play, but for now I'm still trying to figure out the basics. 

I have another project in mind as well, so I'm using this project to get a feel for things before working on a more in depth project.
